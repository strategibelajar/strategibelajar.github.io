                                            Once the Wind and the Sun came to have a
quarrel. Either of them claimed to be a stronger.
At last they agreed to have a trial of strength.
"Here comes a traveller. Let us see who
can strip him of his clock," said the Sun.
The Wind agreed and chose to have the
first turn. He blew in the hardest possible way.
As a result, the traveller wrapped his cloak even
more tightly around him. Then it was the turn
of the Sun. At first he shone very gently. So,
the traveller loosened his cloak from his neck.
The sun went on shining brighter and brighter.
The traveller felt hot. Before long he took off
his cloak and put it in his bag. The Wind had to
accept his defeat.

The Wind and The Sun
The wind and the sun argued one day over which one was the stronger. Spotting a man man traveling on the road, they sported a challenge to see which one could remove the coat from the man's back the quickest.
The wind began. He blew strong gusts of air, so strong that the man could barely walk against them. But the man clutched his coat tight against him. The wind blew harder and longer, and the harder the wind blew, the tighter the man held his coat against him. The wind blew until he was exhausted, but he could not remove the coat from the man's back.
It was now the sun's turn. He gently sent his beams upon the traveler. The sun did very little, but quietly shone upon his head and back until the man became so warm that he took off his coat and headed for the nearest shade tree.</a>

Suddenly they saw a traveler coming down the road, and the Sun said: "I see a way to (18)... our argument. Whichever of us can cause that traveler to take off his cloak shall be regarded as the stronger. You begin." So the Sun retired behind a cloud, and the Wind (19) ... to blow as hard as it could upon the traveler. But the harder he blew the more closely did the traveler wrap his cloak round him, till at last the Wind had to give up in despair. Then the Sun (20) ... out and shone in all his glory upon the traveler. He soon found it too hot to walk with his cloak on. So finally, the traveler took off his cloak.

                                            The North Wind and The Sun The North Wind and the Sun had a quarrel about which of them was the stronger. While they were disputing with much heat and bluster, a Traveler passed along the road wrapped in a cloak. "Let us agree," said the Sun, "That he is the stronger who can strip that Traveler of his cloak." "Very well," growled the North Wind, and at once sent a cold, howling blast against the Traveler. With the first gust of wind the ends of the cloak whipped about the Traveler's body. But he immediately wrapped it closely around him, and the harder the Wind blew, the tighter he held it to him. The North Wind tore angrily at the cloak, but all his efforts were in vain. Then the Sun began to shine. At first his beams were gentle, and in the pleasant warmth after the bitter cold of the North Wind, the Traveler unfastened his cloak and let it hang loosely from his shoulders. The Sun's rays grew warmer. The man took off his cap and mopped his brow. At last he became so heated that he pulled off his cloak, and, to escape the blazing sunshine, threw himself down in the welcome shade of a tree by the roadside. Questions: 1. What kind of argument argued between the Sun and the North Wind? 2. What kind of challenge done by the Sun and the North Wind?3. What did the North Wind do to win the challenge? 4. Why did the man take off his cloak? 5.  What kind of lesson we can take from the story above? mohon bantuannya kak​</a>

                                             The Wind and the Sun The wind and the sun argued about which of them was the strongest. The wind said, "I am so powerful that I can blow all the clouds out of the sky." The sun said, "I am more powerful because I can heat up the sea below and this will produce many more clouds." For a long time, the sun and the wind went on arguing. Just then, they saw a boy walking along the road below. He was wearing a coat. The wind suddenly had an idea. He said, "Let's see who can get the coat off that boy's back." The sun agreed. The wind started first. He blew as hard as he could. He blew from behind and he blew from the front of the boy. The harder he blew, the more tightly the boy held on to his coat to keep it from blowing away. After a while, the wind gave up. Then, it was the sun's turn. It came out from behind the clouds and shore on the boy. The boy felt warm. After that, it began to get hotter and hotter. Soon, the boy could not stand the heat any longer. He took his coat off. The sun won. (Source: My Favorite Fables-Kuala Lumpur)Tolong Bantu cari kosakatanya​</a>

"Here comes a traveller. Let us see who
can strip him of his clock," said the Sun.
The Wind agreed and chose to have the
first turn. He blew in the hardest possible way.
As a result, the traveller wrapped his cloak even
more tightly around him. Then it was the turn
of the Sun. At first he shone very gently. So,
the traveller loosened his cloak from his neck.
The sun went on shining brighter and brighter.
The traveller felt hot. Before long he took off
his cloak and put it in his bag. The Wind had to
accept his defeat.

The Wind and The Sun
The wind and the sun argued one day over which one was the stronger. Spotting a man man traveling on the road, they sported a challenge to see which one could remove the coat from the man's back the quickest.
The wind began. He blew strong gusts of air, so strong that the man could barely walk against them. But the man clutched his coat tight against him. The wind blew harder and longer, and the harder the wind blew, the tighter the man held his coat against him. The wind blew until he was exhausted, but he could not remove the coat from the man's back.
It was now the sun's turn. He gently sent his beams upon the traveler. The sun did very little, but quietly shone upon his head and back until the man became so warm that he took off his coat and headed for the nearest shade tree.</h2><br />

                            32. The North Wind and The Sun The North Wind and the Sun had a quarrel about which of them was the stronger. While they were disputing with much heat and bluster, a Traveler passed along the road wrapped in a cloak. "Let us agree," said the Sun, "That he is the stronger who can strip that Traveler of his cloak." "Very well," growled the North Wind, and at once sent a cold, howling blast against the Traveler. With the first gust of wind the ends of the cloak whipped about the Traveler's body. But he immediately wrapped it closely around him, and the harder the Wind blew, the tighter he held it to him. The North Wind tore angrily at the cloak, but all his efforts were in vain. Then the Sun began to shine. At first his beams were gentle, and in the pleasant warmth after the bitter cold of the North Wind, the Traveler unfastened his cloak and let it hang loosely from his shoulders. The Sun's rays grew warmer. The man took off his cap and mopped his brow. At last he became so heated that he pulled off his cloak, and, to escape the blazing sunshine, threw himself down in the welcome shade of a tree by the roadside. Questions: 1. What kind of argument argued between the Sun and the North Wind? 2. What kind of challenge done by the Sun and the North Wind?3. What did the North Wind do to win the challenge? 4. Why did the man take off his cloak? 5.  What kind of lesson we can take from the story above? mohon bantuannya kak​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p>The argument between the Sun and the North Wind was about which of them was stronger.The challenge was to see who could strip the Traveler of his cloak.The North Wind tried to win the challenge by sending a cold and howling blast against the Traveler, but all his efforts were in vain.The man took off his cloak because the Sun's rays grew warmer and he became too hot.The lesson we can take from the story is that sometimes, gentleness and persistence can be more effective than force and anger.<p></p><br />

The harder he blew, the more tightly the boy held on to his coat to keep it from blowing away. After a while, the wind gave up. Then, it was the sun's turn. It came out from behind the clouds and shore on the boy. The boy felt warm. After that, it began to get hotter and hotter. Soon, the boy could not stand the heat any longer. He took his coat off.
