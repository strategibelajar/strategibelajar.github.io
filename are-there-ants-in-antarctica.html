                                            Ants belong to the insect order Hymenoptera, which also includes the wasps and bees. Anta are distinguished from many of their nearest relatives by two characteristics: a narrow “waist” and elbowed antennae. Ants also differ from most other insects in that they are social, similar to termites and certain bees and wasps. This means that ants live in large cooperative groups called colonies. Two or more generations overlap in the colony: adults take care of the young and are divided into castes, specialized groups that take care of certain tasks. Ants have reproductive castes, the gueens and males, and non-reproductive castes, the workers. Ants are among the most successful insects. Experts estimate that there could be 20,000 or more species of ants in the world. They have evolved to filla variety of different ecological niches as predators, herbivores, leaf-cutters, seed-harvesters, aphid-tenders, and fungus-growers. They are found in deserts and rainforests, mountains and valleys, from the Arctic Circle to the tip of South America. Angs range in size from 0.75 to 52 millimetres. They also vary in colour, most being black or red.Ants feed on many different types of food. Some species will feed on practically anything: others may limit their food to a narrow range. Ants inbesting structures are typically feeding on “people food,” both food in storage (sugar, cakes, cookies, breakfast cereals, etc.) and food from spills and garbage. But they may also be preying on other insects or scavenging on dead insects in windows or lights.

But some types of ants that are well known to humans are black ants, Carpenter ants, red ants, fire ants, and Weaver ants.Most ants are known as social insects, because they form colonies and their regular nests have thousands of ants per colony. One colony can control a large area to support their lives. Colony members are divided into worker ants, male ants and queen ant. It is also possible to have guard ant group. The queen ant is in charge of reproducing (producing eggs) and is highly upheld by the members. The queen ant can live up to 20 years old. All worker ants are females, but they do not produce eggs. They devote themselves to taking care of the eggs of the queen. The most important thing workers ant job is to serve the queen and ensure that the queen and her "babies" are safe.​</a>

Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, and are known for their role in pollination and for producing honey and beeswax. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in nine recognized families though many are undescribed and the actual number is probably higher. They are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants.</a>

But a family of ants may consist of tens of thousands ants. Each ant has its own works to do. There are hunters, workers and soldiers. The hunters hunt  for food for all the ants in the nests. The workers build the nest. Most ants make their nests in the ground. The workers dig holes in the ground and make rooms. The soldiers guard the nests again the strangers and enemies. The workers and the soldiers get their food from the hunters. The queen is a special ant. It gets special food from the hunters. It does not have to work. Her only job is to lay egg.The ants are very interesting. They have been running about everywhere. They seem very busy. They have been looking for food. When an ant finds something, it takes it to the nest. If one ant cannot carry it, it calls its friends to help.ANALIZING A REPORT TEXT OF ANTS.1. WHAT IS THE TITLE OF TEXT? 2.

                                            Ants
Ants are a type of insect with the family Formicidae. Ants have more than 12,000 species, most of which live in the tropics. But some types of ants that are well known to humans are black ants, Carpenter ants, red ants, fire ants, and Weaver ants.
Most ants are known as social insects, because they form colonies and their regular nests have thousands of ants per colony. One colony can control a large area to support their lives. Colony members are divided into worker ants, male ants and queen ant. It is also possible to have guard ant group. The queen ant is in charge of reproducing (producing eggs) and is highly upheld by the members. The queen ant can live up to 20 years old. All worker ants are females, but they do not produce eggs. They devote themselves to taking care of the eggs of the queen. The most important thing workers ant job is to serve the queen and ensure that the queen and her “babies” are safe. In contrast to the Queen with her long age to live, male ants hav shorter life. Their only duty when they are adults is to marry the young ant queen. Male ants usually die 2 weeks after marrying the ant queen.

                            4. Ants belong to the insect order Hymenoptera, which also includes the wasps and bees. Anta are distinguished from many of their nearest relatives by two characteristics: a narrow “waist” and elbowed antennae. Ants also differ from most other insects in that they are social, similar to termites and certain bees and wasps. This means that ants live in large cooperative groups called colonies. Two or more generations overlap in the colony: adults take care of the young and are divided into castes, specialized groups that take care of certain tasks. Ants have reproductive castes, the gueens and males, and non-reproductive castes, the workers. Ants are among the most successful insects. Experts estimate that there could be 20,000 or more species of ants in the world. They have evolved to filla variety of different ecological niches as predators, herbivores, leaf-cutters, seed-harvesters, aphid-tenders, and fungus-growers. They are found in deserts and rainforests, mountains and valleys, from the Arctic Circle to the tip of South America. Angs range in size from 0.75 to 52 millimetres. They also vary in colour, most being black or red.Ants feed on many different types of food. Some species will feed on practically anything: others may limit their food to a narrow range. Ants inbesting structures are typically feeding on “people food,” both food in storage (sugar, cakes, cookies, breakfast cereals, etc.) and food from spills and garbage. But they may also be preying on other insects or scavenging on dead insects in windows or lights.

                            38. Ants
Ants are a type of insect with the family Formicidae. Ants have more than 12,000 species, most of which live in the tropics. But some types of ants that are well known to humans are black ants, Carpenter ants, red ants, fire ants, and Weaver ants.
Most ants are known as social insects, because they form colonies and their regular nests have thousands of ants per colony. One colony can control a large area to support their lives. Colony members are divided into worker ants, male ants and queen ant. It is also possible to have guard ant group. The queen ant is in charge of reproducing (producing eggs) and is highly upheld by the members. The queen ant can live up to 20 years old. All worker ants are females, but they do not produce eggs. They devote themselves to taking care of the eggs of the queen. The most important thing workers ant job is to serve the queen and ensure that the queen and her “babies” are safe. In contrast to the Queen with her long age to live, male ants hav shorter life. Their only duty when they are adults is to marry the young ant queen. Male ants usually die 2 weeks after marrying the ant queen.
