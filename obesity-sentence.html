                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p></p>Write the correct answer!<p></p><p>1) For either type of person—as well as for the vast majority of sleepers who fall somewhere in between—the best bedtime is the hour of the evening when they feel most sleepy. That means night owls shouldn't try to force themselves to bed at 9 or 10 if they're not tired.</p><p></p><p>2) Sleeping too much or too little could make you weigh too much, as well. One recent study showed that people who slept for nine or 10 hours every night were 21% more likely to become obese over a six-year period than were people who slept between seven and eight hours.</p><p></p><p>3) Oversleeping is called hypersomnia or “long sleeping.” This condition affects about 2 percent of people. People with hypersomnia might require as many as 10 to 12 hours of sleep per night to feel their best.</p><p></p><p>4) For some people prone to headaches, sleeping longer than usual on a weekend or vacation can cause head pain. Researchers believe this is due to the effect oversleeping has on certain neurotransmitters in the brain, including serotonin.</p><p></p><p>5) That's because it disrupts the normal sleep cycle. Of course, not everyone who oversleeps has a sleep disorder. Other possible causes of oversleeping include the use of certain substances, such as alcohol and some prescription medications. Other medical conditions, including depression, can cause people to oversleep.</p><p></p><p>_________________________</p><p><strong>Detail Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Mata Pelajaran: Bahasa Inggris</p><p>Kelas: VIII (JHS)</p><p>Materi: Sleeping</p><p>Kode: 2.1.1</p><p>Tanggal: 9-11-2020</p><p></p><p></p><p>//Semoga membantu.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>There are several interconnected reasons why childhood obesity has increased in the United States:</p><p></p><p>1. Lack of physical activity: With the rise of sedentary activities like watching TV, playing video games, and using mobile devices, children are spending more time sitting down and less time being physically active. Regular exercise and physical activity is important for maintaining a healthy weight.</p><p></p><p>2. Unhealthy eating habits: Children are consuming more high-fat, high-sugar, and high-calorie foods that are high in salt and additives, which contribute to weight gain and obesity. Many children consume fast food and processed foods that are high in fat and calories, while consuming fewer fruits, vegetables, and nutrient-rich food.</p><p></p><p>3. Lack of education: Many children and families lack access to information and education about healthy eating habits and physical activity. Children who grow up in communities with limited access to supermarkets and fresh produce, or who have low-income families, are more likely to lack healthy food options at home.</p><p></p><p>4. Genetics and biology: Some children may be more predisposed to gain weight due to their genetics or underlying medical conditions.</p><p></p><p>5. Environmental factors: Other factors such as pollution, stress, and lack of sleep can contribute to childhood obesity.</p><p></p><p>Overall, addressing childhood obesity will require improvements in the food environment, increased physical activity, and better education and awareness for parents, children, and communities.</p><br />
