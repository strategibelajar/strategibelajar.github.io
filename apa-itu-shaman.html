                                            buat lah moral story dari cerita di bawah ini"ulak Lia lake” , Once upon a time lived a beautiful princess in Soak Baru Village, Musi Banyuasin District, South Sumatra. She lived with her parents. Her name was “Dahlia”but people called her “Lia”. She was very beautiful. Many people admired her with her beauty and also they wanted to Dahlia to be their wife. The report about the beauty of Dahlia was heard by Matjitu who was rich man in Soak Baru Village. He wanted her as his wife. One day, he came to lia’s house to propose her to be his wife but she refused his proposal because she did not love him. After this incedent, Matjitu met shaman to make lia feel ashamed with bad smelling and having scabies. Because his love clapped one hand, he made dahlia ashamed with bad smelling and having scabies. Many citizen lived around lia’s house were disturbed by her bad smelling and her skin and they expelled lia to go from their village. Then, our parents were sad and isolated lia at the bank of Lake. She lived alone for years. This report was heard by matjitu. He was very happy because his scheming granted. Day to days, month to months, and year to years, lia lived alone and her illness could not recover. Lia felt hopeless and want to suicide because she could not bear her pain. Then, there was yellow crocodile which appeared from lake. In this incident, there was a man who was fishing in this lake and he saw that lia was eaten by crocodile. He run away from lake to inform her family about its accident. Then his family and her neighbor heard this information go to lake to see lia. The parents and many people searched Lia. It was not far from lake, her body was found by them. She was so kind, she sacrificed her life to you all. Citizen: sorry mam, we know that she is so kind. Although she made ashamed by matjitu but she does not take revenge to him. We are regretful about this incident. To memorize this incident we give the name of this lake “Ulak Lia Lake”. Lia was buried at bank of this lake. After this incident, many people called this place “Ulak Lia Lake” to memorize her kindness. ​</a>

Reread the complete story of 'The Legend of N'o Snake' and underline the verbs used in the story. List the verbs that you have found here. Read the verbs that you written in the column. Those verbs express actions (whether it is physical or mental action). They explain what the subject does. Therefore, they are action verbs. Reread the collections of verbs that you have found from the legend. You might have found words, such as lived, made, called, etc. They are in the past form which mean the action in the sentence takes place in the past. They tense. We use past tense for: 1. actions that happened at a specific time in the past for example: One day, the mother got severe pain that she could not move from her bed. Once upon a time, on the slopes of a mountain in Jambi province, there lived a poor mother and her three daug 2. a sequence of short actions for example: The youngest daughter then went back home, gave the flower and the magic pot to the shaman, and immediat . back to the mountain The first and second daughters took the prince's snake skin, burned it all, and put the ash next to the youngest Let's have another practice.

                                            The story of Nyi Roro Kidul originated from a beautiful-looking princess named Kadita. Because of her charming beauty, she was also called Dewi Srengenge (the beautiful sun). Kadita's father was a king named Munding Wangi. However, having a beautiful daughter like Kadita did not make Munding Wangi happy. The reason was that he did not want to have a daughter. Munding Wangi then married again with Dewi Mutiara and was blessed with a son. Immediately, the birth of a son made him very happy. Although Mundi Wangi had a son as he wished, his love for Kadita still would not fade.On the other hand, Dewi Mutiara hoped her son could become a king. She would do anything to realize his desire. She even expelled Kadita, her stepdaughter, out of the kingdom that made King Munding Wangi furious. Of course, the Munding Wangi King would not let anyone hurt his beautiful daughter.However, Dewi Mutiara did not lose sense and kept trying to expel Kadita.The next day, Dewi Mutiara sent a shaman to curse Kadita into full of scabies on her body.When Kadita awoke, she realized that her whole body was stinking and made her cry hysterically.Hearing the news, the king was very upset and sad. He then called a doctor to cure Kadita's disease.Unfortunately, it did not work. The king then realized that her daughter's disease was not natural. Finally, he sent Kadita out of the kingdom and avoided gossip in all countries.On her trip for seven days and seven nights, Kadita arrived in the Southern Ocean. She looked at the clear and clean sea. After that, Kadita tried to jump and swim in the ocean. Miraculously, when her body was exposed to ocean water, her disease little by little faded and she became beautiful again, even more beautiful than ever. Furthermore, Kadita now had power over the South Ocean and was called Nyi Roro Kidul or the Queen of the Southern Sea.As the Queen of the Southern Sea, the existence of Nyi Roro Kidul is still highly respected by the local community and has become part of the culture. Some people who do not believe this legend say that the myth was deliberately created to strengthen the legitimacy of ancient kings. However, there are even some places that supposedly become the real world link with Nyi Rorol Kidul.The traits of Dewi Mutiara are ….A. Curious and powerfulB. Wicked and lazyC. Calm and impoliteD. Rebellious and generousE. Mean and highly-determined​</a>

                                                      Once upon a time, there was a couple living in a forest. They used to be a happy couple, but after years, they loved each other less. The husband chose to spend more time working in the field rather than staying home with his wife. This made the wife sad. The expected the husband to be more patient, caring and loving towards her.          Feeling frustrated, the wife tried to seek help from a shaman living not far from their house. She told the shaman about her marriage and disappointed with her husband. She asked the shaman for a love potion that could make her husband fall in love with her again. The shaman thought for a while before finally asking the wife to get him a whisker from the lion. The wife hesitated at first, but she finally agreed to do that.          The next morning, the woman carried a huge piece of raw meat to the jungle. She put the meat neara big tree and then she hid herself behind the tree. After a while, she saw a lion slowly approached themeat and ate it. The lion knew she was there, but it didn’t bother her. The wife felt so happy so she didthis every day over and over again to tame the lion. The lion finally learnt that she was the one who gavethe food. One day, she finally had the courage to get the whisker from the lion’s mouth. When the lionwas eating its meal, she slowly came closer to the lion. Then, with a gentle move, she grabbed the whisker and pulled it from the lion. Instead of chasing  her, the lion went back into the jungle. The wife was so happy that she manage to get the whisker safely. Then she ran to the shaman’s house immediately.          The wife excitedly handed the whisker to the shaman. The shaman smiled proudly at her and said,‘This proves that you are a brave, clever, and patient woman. You don’t need any potion. Show your love to your husband every day. Care for him and win his heart back. Share his problems, make him feel welcome and give him some time. Love works two ways, my dear. Both of you need to show love each other.’ The wife kept silent for a while before she went back home.          Then the wife followed the shaman’s advice. She reached out to her husband and started to talk to him again, comforted him after a long day, and cooked him dinner. Slowly, her husband turned into a loving and caring person again. Both of them lived happily like they used to be.          13. What does the first paragraph tell us about?      A. A tough wife					C. A family problem      B. A lonely husband					D.

She lived alone for years. This report was heard by matjitu. He was very happy because his scheming granted. Day to days, month to months, and year to years, lia lived alone and her illness could not recover. Lia felt hopeless and want to suicide because she could not bear her pain. Then, there was yellow crocodile which appeared from lake. In this incident, there was a man who was fishing in this lake and he saw that lia was eaten by crocodile. He run away from lake to inform her family about its accident. Then his family and her neighbor heard this information go to lake to see lia. The parents and many people searched Lia. It was not far from lake, her body was found by them. She was so kind, she sacrificed her life to you all. Citizen: sorry mam, we know that she is so kind. Although she made ashamed by matjitu but she does not take revenge to him. We are regretful about this incident. To memorize this incident we give the name of this lake “Ulak Lia Lake”. Lia was buried at bank of this lake. After this incident, many people called this place “Ulak Lia Lake” to memorize her kindness. ​</h2><br />

                        <p>Halo, saya Mamat.  Saya seorang siswa kelas empat.  Saya merasa takut dan khawatir tetapi di saat yang sama juga merasa senang karena saya akan disunat Sabtu depan.  Di Betawi, kami menyebutnya sunatan.  Sebelum disunat saya akan diarak menyusuri lingkungan tempat tinggal saya terlebih dahulu dengan menaiki kereta kuda.  Prosesi ini bertujuan agar para calon pengantin sunat termasuk saya merasa bahagia sebelum menghadapi khitanan.  Biasanya calon pengantin wanita akan mengenakan selempang, jubah, dan alas kaki khusus.  Mereka juga akan memakai baju koko sarung dan peci.  Ini adalah perayaan untuk semua orang.  Banyak sekali hiburan dalam upacara khitanan ini seperti orkes tanjidor, pertunjukan lagu dangdut dan marawis dan keesokan harinya khitanan dimulai proses khitanannya sendiri dilakukan oleh dukun khitanan, bengkong, mantri atau dokter.  Ayahku berkata bahwa aku akan tumbuh dewasa begitu upacara khitanan selesai itu artinya aku harus kuat dan bijak dan aku juga harus melaksanakan shalat, 5 kali dalam sehari dengan patuh.  </p><p></p><p>pertayaan: </p><p></p><p>1.

Ditengah misi, ketujuh jendral yang diculik, enam diantaranya malah dibunuh, dan satu orang lainnya berhasil meloloskan diri. Sehingga ketujuh jendral tersebut tak pernah dihadapkan sama sekali dengan Presiden Soekarno. Apa bila Suharto tahu kalau rencana penculikan itu berubah menjadi pembantaian, berarti secara tidak langsung Suharto terlibat dalam pembunuhan rekan-rekan seperjuangannya sendiri.</p><p>Setelah peristiwa G30S terjadi, Soeharto muncul sebagai tokoh penyelamat. Atas kuasanya, beliau menggerakan pasukannya untuk melakukan proses pencarian para jendral yang hilang, dan melakukan operasi pemulihan keamanan, termasuk pembersihan (penumpasan) terhadap PKI dan simpatisannya. </p><p>Sampai pada akhirnya Soeharto menerima Supersemar. Berbekal surat perintah itu, pada 12 Maret 1966, kemudian membubarkan PKI dan menyatakannya sebagai partai terlarang di Indonesia. Setelah MPRS menolak laporan pertanggungjawaban Presiden Soekarno, Soeharto dengan mulus diangkat menjadi presiden kedua Republik Indonesia.</p>SEMOGA MEMBANTU.<br />

                            11. The story of Nyi Roro Kidul originated from a beautiful-looking princess named Kadita. Because of her charming beauty, she was also called Dewi Srengenge (the beautiful sun). Kadita's father was a king named Munding Wangi. However, having a beautiful daughter like Kadita did not make Munding Wangi happy. The reason was that he did not want to have a daughter. Munding Wangi then married again with Dewi Mutiara and was blessed with a son. Immediately, the birth of a son made him very happy. Although Mundi Wangi had a son as he wished, his love for Kadita still would not fade.On the other hand, Dewi Mutiara hoped her son could become a king. She would do anything to realize his desire. She even expelled Kadita, her stepdaughter, out of the kingdom that made King Munding Wangi furious. Of course, the Munding Wangi King would not let anyone hurt his beautiful daughter.However, Dewi Mutiara did not lose sense and kept trying to expel Kadita.The next day, Dewi Mutiara sent a shaman to curse Kadita into full of scabies on her body.When Kadita awoke, she realized that her whole body was stinking and made her cry hysterically.Hearing the news, the king was very upset and sad. He then called a doctor to cure Kadita's disease.Unfortunately, it did not work. The king then realized that her daughter's disease was not natural. Finally, he sent Kadita out of the kingdom and avoided gossip in all countries.On her trip for seven days and seven nights, Kadita arrived in the Southern Ocean. She looked at the clear and clean sea. After that, Kadita tried to jump and swim in the ocean. Miraculously, when her body was exposed to ocean water, her disease little by little faded and she became beautiful again, even more beautiful than ever. Furthermore, Kadita now had power over the South Ocean and was called Nyi Roro Kidul or the Queen of the Southern Sea.As the Queen of the Southern Sea, the existence of Nyi Roro Kidul is still highly respected by the local community and has become part of the culture. Some people who do not believe this legend say that the myth was deliberately created to strengthen the legitimacy of ancient kings.

The husband chose to spend more time working in the field rather than staying home with his wife. This made the wife sad. The expected the husband to be more patient, caring and loving towards her.          Feeling frustrated, the wife tried to seek help from a shaman living not far from their house. She told the shaman about her marriage and disappointed with her husband. She asked the shaman for a love potion that could make her husband fall in love with her again. The shaman thought for a while before finally asking the wife to get him a whisker from the lion. The wife hesitated at first, but she finally agreed to do that.          The next morning, the woman carried a huge piece of raw meat to the jungle. She put the meat neara big tree and then she hid herself behind the tree. After a while, she saw a lion slowly approached themeat and ate it. The lion knew she was there, but it didn’t bother her. The wife felt so happy so she didthis every day over and over again to tame the lion. The lion finally learnt that she was the one who gavethe food. One day, she finally had the courage to get the whisker from the lion’s mouth. When the lionwas eating its meal, she slowly came closer to the lion. Then, with a gentle move, she grabbed the whisker and pulled it from the lion. Instead of chasing  her, the lion went back into the jungle. The wife was so happy that she manage to get the whisker safely. Then she ran to the shaman’s house immediately.          The wife excitedly handed the whisker to the shaman. The shaman smiled proudly at her and said,‘This proves that you are a brave, clever, and patient woman. You don’t need any potion. Show your love to your husband every day. Care for him and win his heart back. Share his problems, make him feel welcome and give him some time. Love works two ways, my dear. Both of you need to show love each other.’ The wife kept silent for a while before she went back home.          Then the wife followed the shaman’s advice. She reached out to her husband and started to talk to him again, comforted him after a long day, and cooked him dinner. Slowly, her husband turned into a loving and caring person again. Both of them lived happily like they used to be.          13. What does the first paragraph tell us about?      A. A tough wife					C. A family problem      B. A lonely husband					D.
